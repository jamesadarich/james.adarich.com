## Have a goal

And only one goal

## Images are your friends

## Avoid words

Don't write what you're saying - noone is going to listen to you

## Say no to bullet points

## Engage your audience

Make sure they're awake

## Don't be afraid to defer questions

Questions are good and they should be encouraged throughout but if they interrupt the flow or are becoming off topic
